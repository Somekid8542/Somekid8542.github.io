					<h2>Tim Adams <br/>
					Co-Creator</h2>
					<img src="images/tim_adams.jpg" height=500px>
					<p style="width:500px;">Being one of our co-creators is no easy job, but Tim Adams does the job fantastically. He is responsible for the creation of the rewards that you get from defeating enemies and getting loot chests. He also coded the RNG, so blame him if luck doesn't seem to be on your side.</p>
				</div>
				<div style="float:right; width:50%;">
					<h2 style="text-align:right;">Goridion Hrtsjurl <br/>
					Co-Creator</h2>
					<img style="position:relative; left:25%;" src="images/goridion_hrtsjurl.jpg" height=500px width=500px>
					<p style="width:500px; position:relative; left:25%;">Without Goridion, you wouldn't have the stupendous enemies you have today. He carefully crafts them so they can pose a serious challenge to the player yet still possible to defeat. He also created the dungeon layouts, so you know they are top-notch. Working together with Tim Adams on this project is a dream come true for him.</p>

				<div style="float:left; width:50%;">
					<h2>Thxas <br/>
					Security</h2>
					<img src="images/thxas.jpg" height=500px width=500px>
					<p style="width:500px;">We don't actually have a picture of Thxas, but we figured this should do the job of how threatening he is. A strong and skilled sword master, he will gladly remove people from the dungeon who are breaking the rules. On his time off, he enjoys watching sunsets, being an avid bird-watcher, and a relaxing rhino-pig killing session.</p>

				<div style="float:right; width:50%;">
					<h2 style="text-align:right;">Alice Kirstich<br/>
					Accountant</h2>
					<img style="position:relative; left:25%;" src="images/alice_kirstich.jpg" height=500px width=500px>
					<p style="width:500px; position:relative; left:25%;">No one alive has seen her without her mask. She is an excellent accountant and keeps all of our funding accurate so we can stay running. When she has personal time, she loves to [placeholder].</p>
<p style="width:500px; font-size:12px; position:relative; left:25%;">ATTENTION EMPLOYEES: Find a way for a person to ask Alice about her personal life without losing their voice. She says it's not her fault but there are doubts.</p>
