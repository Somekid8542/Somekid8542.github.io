		<h1>New Restaurant gets<br/> 		Raving Fans</h1>
		<p>A new Chinese restaurant has appeared in the city of San Marcos called "The Mandarin". The restaurant <br/>
		specializes in noodle dishes, and uses interesting sounding names for them. Some names include <q><em>Shogun's <br/>
		Delight</em></q>, <q><em>The Panda Chow-Down</em></q>, and a very spicy dish simply called <q><em>The Dragon</em></q>. They also serve other <br/>
		dishes such as soups and dumplings.</p>
		<h2>Mandarin Craze</h2>
		<p>The Mandarin launched a grand opening where people who came to the restaurant on the day they opened would <br/>
		get 25% off. As soon as the doors opened, almost all of the seats were already taken up by hungry customers <br/>
		waiting outside. In less than an hour, people were already lined up waiting for a table to opening up. The <br/>
		restaurant stayed packed and bustling for the whole rest of the day and most of the evening.</p>
		<h2>Critical Appraise</h2>
		<p>With so many people lined up, the food had better be good, right? Luckily, the wait wasn't a waste. As customers <br/>
		came out of the restaurant, all of them raved about how incredible and flavorful the food was and highly <br/>
		recommended the place. <q>I couldn't believe how delicious their Panda noodle dish was,</q> one customer stated. <br/>
		<q>Nobody should have to go their life without coming to The Mandarin.</q> The restaurant has already gotten 45 <br/>
		5-star reviews in the 1 week that it has been open as of the writing of this paper, and it continues to rise each day.</p>
