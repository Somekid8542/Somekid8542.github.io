Raving Fans</b></span></h1>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A new Chinese restaurant has appeared in the city of San Marcos called "The Mandarin". The restaurant specializes in <br>
noodle dishes, and uses interesting sounding names for them. Some names include <i>"Shogun's Delight"</i>, <i>"The Panda <br>
Chow-Down"</i>, and a very spicy dish simply called <i>"The Dragon"</i>. They also serve other dishes such as soups and dumplings.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Mandarin launched a grand opening where people who came to the restaurant on the day they opened would get 25% off. <br>
As soon as the doors opened, almost all of the seats were already taken up by hungry customers waiting outside. In less than <br>
an hour, people were already lined up waiting for a table to opening up. The restaurant stayed packed and bustling for the <br>
whole rest of the day and most of the evening.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With so many people lined up, the food had better be good, right? Luckily, the wait wasn't a waste. As customers came out of <br>
the restaurant, all of them raved about how incredible and flavorful the food was and highly recommended the place. “<i>I <br>
couldn't believe how delicious their Panda noodle dish was,</i>” one customer stated. “<i>Nobody should have to go their life without <br>
coming to The Mandarin.</i>” The restaurant has already gotten 45 5-star reviews in the 1 week that it has been open as of the <br>
writing of this paper, and it continues to rise each day.</span></p>
